<h2> Hi, I'm Denzel. Thanks for Stopping By 👋</h2> 
I'm a Data Scientist switching over to the "dark side". In my Data Science training I discovered my passion for data/analytics engineering. I love thinking about data architecting and infrastructure. I want to be the person that can handle Big Data and serve it buffet style, where anyone in the organization can easily use what they want, when they want. 

<h3>Data Science Projects that had Heavy Engineering Portions</h3>
<ol> 
  <li> 
    <b><a href="https://github.com/Williamdst/Bike-Share-USA">Bike Share USA</a></b> - <i>Horizontal Expansion Regession Model</i> 🚴‍♂️
    <br />
    <b> My neighborhood doesn't have bike sharing and I REALLY want bike sharing </b>. So, the objective of the project was to build a model that can predict the number of bike share stations that should be created in zip codes surrounding a company’s current network of bike stations. This model is to be used as a guide for a horizontal expansion to break into new areas. 
    <p align='center'><b>In this project I designed a logical model of a database, implementing it in AWS RDS, and performed ETL jobs to transfer 68GB of wrangled data from 5 unique S3 buckets.</b></p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <b><a href="https://github.com/Williamdst/The-Subway-Challenge">The Subway Challenge</a></b> - <i>World Record Route Generator</i> 🚄
    <br />
    <b>With the aim of securing a spot in Guinness</b>, this project used graph theory to determine a set of potential paths that can be used to set world record in the Subway Challenge.
    <p align="center"><b>In this project I integrated a SQLite database into my program to store the generated data </p>
